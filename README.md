# Scotiabank-Terrorist-Attacks-at-the-NYC-World-Trade-Center
As a service to a large number of working parents in The World Trade Center Plaza located in New York City, a daycare was opened in building 1. The childcare program was called “World Kids, New York City” and was designed as a very interactive program which delivered bi-daily field trips throughout the boroughs of New York City. World Kids was advertised as a “Daycare with Culture”. The goal of the program was to offer children of those who worked in world economics with a world view in which would be relatable with family values and allow children to participate in real-world dinner conversations. Many of the childcare workers if not all were college students, otherwise graduates with degrees relevant to childcare education, arts, fitness, health, nursing or other backgrounds needed to host very progressive and educational daily activities. The initial childcare fees were around $100 a week. This childcare option was not the cheapest or most expensive, but it was created as an educational and healthy platform that enriched the quality of life for many families. The daycare was launched on March 17, 1999 by Jonathan Berkman and his Wife Sarah after Jon had been whiteness to a poor selection of childcare operations in Manhattan. He saw stuffy, cramped daycares that left once a day at max, to city parks in the neighborhood and served bland food that he felt bad serving to children. The daycares lacked a focus on education, Jon believed that while children still have mental elasticity every opportunity should be taken to fill their minds with knowledge which is the ultimate source of power and control over one’s life. Jon created a “Brain Elasticity” program which was designed to stretch the limits of young children’s learning potential. Jon and Sarah’s daycare featured a full range of musical instruments, an art studio, a game room and a library that was constantly growing. World Kids “mat room” allowed children to exercise and burn energy, focusing on a healthy mind, and healthy body approach. World Kids brought in instructors in Music, Art, Fitness, Education and Health to teach classes and seminars which created an environment much like school, except without desks and with much more hands-on learning. Only legal requirements of teaching credentials limited the daycare program from operating as a small schoolhouse within the World Trade Center.
